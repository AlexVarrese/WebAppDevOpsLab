# Lab 3: Create an Azure Web App

[Azure Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/app-service/app-service-web-overview) is an Azure service for hosting web applications. In this lab you'll create the Azure Web App into which you will later deploy the web application using Continuous Deployment.

1. In a browser go to the Azure Portal at http://portal.azure.com.

6. Click OK to save the App Service Plan.

7. Click Create to save and create the Web App.

8. After a short time (approx. 1-2 mins) you should see a notification that the Web App has been successfully created. You may want to pin the web app to your Azure dashboard for easy location later on:

11. Your Web App should open in the browser and you will see something like this:

The exact page details will change over time but this now confirms that you have created a Web App in Azure. In the next lab we will deploy the web application into the newly created Azure Web App.
